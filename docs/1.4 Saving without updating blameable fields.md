# Culpa for Laravel 5 -  Saving without updating blameable fields

In some cases it might not be desirable to use Culpa.

You can disable it in your model by setting the blamable variable to false. Take a look at the example below:

```php
use Culpa\Traits\Blameable;
use Culpa\Traits\CreatedBy;
use Culpa\Traits\DeletedBy;
use Culpa\Traits\UpdatedBy;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model

class Article extends Model
{
    use Blameable, CreatedBy, UpdatedBy;

    protected $blameable = array('created', 'updated', 'deleted');
    
    /**
     * Remove the article form the headlines without leaving a trace who changed it.
     * usually called by cli to ensure articles are not featured longer than 2 weeks
     */
    public function removeFromFeatured()
    {
        $this->blameable = false;
        $this->setFeatured(false);
    
        return $this->save();
    }
}
```
