# Culpa for Laravel 5 - Changing the user source

By default, the `BlameableObserver` will use the `Auth` facade to retrieve the current user. 
You can however, overwrite this logic in your configuration at the `culpa.users.active_user` field.
An example of changing this configuration to sentry is shown below.

```php 
        /*
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        | Custom User Source
        |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |
        | Enabling this closure breaks laravel's feature to cache config files
        | The default (commented) option should work for you if you are using the default Auth provider.
        | @see: https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/9625
        |
        | @return int|null User ID, or null if not authenticated
        |
        |

        'active_user' => function() {
              return Sentry::check() ? Sentry::getUser()->id : null;
        }
```

Please note, putting a closure in your config will crash your application when trying to cache your configuration.
